# Request PATh Facility Credits

All compute time on the PATh Facility is charged using a credit system.

Credits are granted from the NSF and associated with the active project.
This guide details the process and templates available to request
credits.

PATh staff can provide a small startup allocation at any time for
initial testing before a full credit request.

## Requirements

The opportunity to use PATh Facility resources is available to all PIs
submitting, or having submitted, proposals to the programs listed below:
[Program Officers](#program-officers)

## How to Apply

* **New Proposals:** As documented in the [PAPPG 24-1, Ch 2, section E.7](https://new.nsf.gov/policies/pappg/24-1/ch-2-proposal-preparation#ch2E7),
projects can request credits as part of the award process.  Include the
request for HTC resources as a Supplementary Document attached to the
proposal (as described in the original DCL NSF 22-051).

* **Existing Awards:** Email the NSF cognizant program officer of their
project, and copy credit-accounts@path-cc.io, with the description of
their HTC resource request. Please include "HTCAccess" and the award
number for the funded project in the e-mail subject line.

### Sample Credit Request

The credit request should include:

> (1) the anticipated total HTC resources required, with yearly breakdown;
> and (2) a technical description and justification for the request. The
> latter should include information regarding (a) the expected number of
> self-contained tasks per ensemble ‒ note that each task can be packaged
> into one or more batch job(s); (b) the resource requirements for each
> task type in the ensemble ‒ for example, requirements for cores, memory,
> wall-time, and scratch space; (c) the expected number of ensembles; (d)
> the expected input and output data requirements for each task type; and
> (e) the expected number and size of shared input files within an
> ensemble – expected number of times each file is read per ensemble.

This should be no more than two pages. The Research Facilitation team
has assembled a template credit request for you to use as a starting
point: [Template for NSF PATh Credit Requests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aHnihTmrW_gprIy8K_60No343SBysNM0Tf1Lv1ZpY7o/)

## How Many Credits? 

If you are not sure how many credits to request for your allocation, please 
do one or more of the following:

* Use the credit calculator developed by the Facilitation team: 
	* Go to the sample credit calculator here: [PATh Facility Credit Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HLW2HETHiWAGxr4_qs6rEovPrZthkJlLoDpgRPKmrF4/)
	* Follow the instructions in the calculator - make a copy and fill in information 
	about your jobs and ensembles to generate a credit estimate. 
* Contact the PATh Facility team at credit-accounts@path-cc.io
* Request an account and startup allocation on the PATh Facility to run test 
jobs and determine resource needs and possible scale: [Getting Started](https://portal.path-cc.io/documentation/overview/account_setup/getting-started/)

The current credit system is documented on this page: [PATh Facility Credit Charges](https://portal.path-cc.io/documentation/overview/references/credit-account-charges/).
