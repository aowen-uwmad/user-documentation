Containers - Docker
===================

The OSPool is using Apptainer/Singularity to execute containers. It is recommended
that if you are building your own custom container, you use the 
[Apptainer/Singularity image defintion format](../containers-singularity). 
However, Docker images can also be used on the OSPool and a Docker image is 
sometimes the more appropriate choice. For example:

 * There is an existing image on Docker Hub
 * You found a Dockerfile which meets your requirements
 * You have Docker installed on your own machine and want to 
   develop the code/image locally before using it on the OSPool

This guide contains examples on how to build your own Docker image, how
to convert a Docker image to Apptainer/Singularity, and how to import a
Docker image from the Docker Hub.

## Building Your Own Docker Image

If you already have an existing Docker container image, skip
to [Preparing Docker Containers for HTCondor Jobs](#preparing-docker-containers-for-htcondor-jobs). Otherwise, continue reading. 

### Identify Components

What software do you want to install? Make sure that you have either the source 
code or a command that can be used to install it through Linux (like `apt-get` or 
`yum`). You'll also need to choose a "base" container, on which to add your particular 
software or tools.

### Building

There are two main methods for generating your own container image. 

1. Editing the `Dockerfile`
2. Editing the default image using local Docker

We recommend the first option, as it is more reproducible, but the second option 
can be useful for troubleshooting or especially tricky installs. 

#### Dockerfile

Create a folder on your computer and inside it, create a blank text file 
called `Dockerfile`.  

The first line of this file should include the keyword `FROM` and then 
the name of a Docker image (from Docker Hub) you want 
to use as your starting point. If using the OSG's Ubuntu 22.04 image that 
would look like this: 

	FROM hub.opensciencegrid.org/htc/ubuntu:22.04

Then, for each command you want to run to add libraries or software, use the 
keyword `RUN` and then the command. Sometimes it makes sense to string 
commands together using the `&&` operator and line breaks `\`, like so:

	RUN apt-get update -y && \
	    apt-get install -y build-essentials

or

	RUN wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.6.0.tar.gz && \
	    tar -xzf R-3.6.0.tar.gz && \
	    cd R-3.6.0 && \
	    ./configure && \
	    make && \
	    make install

Typically it's good to group together commands installing the same kind of thing 
(system libraries, or software packages, or an installation process) under one `RUN` command, 
and then have multiple `RUN` commands, one for each of the different type of 
software or package you're installing. 

(For all the possible Dockerfile keywords, see the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/))

Once your Dockerfile is ready, you can "build" the container image by running this command: 

    $ docker build -t namespace/repository_name .

Note that the naming convention for Docker images is your Docker Hub username and then 
a name you choose for that particular container image. So if my Docker Hub username 
is `alice` and I created an image with the NCBI `blast` tool, I might use this name: 

    $ docker build -t alice/NCBI-blast .

#### Editing an Image Interactively

You can also build an image interactively, without a Dockerfile. First, get 
the desired starting image from Docker Hub. Again, we will
look at the OSG Ubuntu 22.04 image. 

    $ docker pull hub.opensciencegrid.org/htc/ubuntu:22.04

We will run the image in a docker interactive session

    $ docker run -it --name <docker_session_name_here> hub.opensciencegrid.org/htc/ubuntu:22.04 /bin/bash

Giving the session a name is important because it will make it easier to 
reattach the session later and commit the changes later on. Now you will 
be greeted by a new command line prompt that will look something like this

    [root@740b9db736a1 /]#

You can now install the software that you need through the default package 
manager, in this case `apt-get`. 

    [root@740b9db736a1 /]# apt-get install build-essentials

Once you have installed all the software, you simply `exit`

    [root@740b9db736a1 /]# exit

Now you can commit the changes to the image and give it a name: 

    docker commit <docker_session_name_here> namespace/repository_name

You can also use the session's hash as found in the command prompt (`740b9db736a1` 
in the above example) in place of the docker session name. 


## Preparing Docker Containers for HTCondor Jobs

Once you have a Docker container image, whether created by you or found 
on DockerHub, you should convert it to the "sif" image format for 
the best experience on the OSpool. 

### Convert Docker containers on Docker Hub or online

If the Docker container you want to use is online, on a site like Docker Hub, you can 
log in to your Access Point and run a single command to convert it to a `.sif` image: 

	$ apptainer build my-container.sif docker://owner/repository:tag

Where the path at the end of the command is customized to be the container image
you want to use. 

### Convert Docker containers on your computer

If you have built a Docker image on your own host, you can save it as a 
tar file and then convert it to an Apptainer/Singularity SIF image. First
find the image id:

    $ docker image list
    REPOSITORY              IMAGE ID
    awesome/science         f1e7972c55bc

Using the image id, save the image to a tar file:

    $ docker save f1e7972c55bc -o my-container.tar

Transfer `my-container.tar` to the OSPool access point, and use
Apptainer to convert it to a SIF image:

    $ apptainer build my-container.sif docker-archive://my-container.tar

## Using Containers in HTCondor Jobs

After converting the Docker image to a sif format, you can use the 
image in your job as described in the
[Apptainer/Singularity Guide](../containers-singularity#using-singularity-or-apptainer-images-in-an-htcondor-job). 

## Special Cases

### ENTRYPOINT and ENV

Two options that can be used in the Dockerfile to set the environment or 
default command are `ENTRYPOINT` and `ENV`. Unfortunately, both of these 
aspects of the Docker container are deleted when it is converted to a 
Singularity image in the Open Science Pool.

### Apptainer/Singularity Environment

One approach for setting up the environment for an image which will
be converted to Apptainer/Singularity, is to put a file under
`/.singularity.d/env/`. These files will be sourced when the container
get instantiated. For example, if you have Conda environment, add this
to the end of your Dockerfile:

    # set up environment for when using the container, this is for when 
    # we invoke the container with Apptainer/Singularity
    RUN mkdir -p /.singularity.d/env && \
        echo ". /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" >>/.singularity.d/env/91-environment.sh && \
        echo "conda activate" >>/.singularity.d/env/91-environment.sh
