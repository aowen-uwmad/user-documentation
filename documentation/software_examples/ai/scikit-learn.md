# scikit-learn

scikit-learn is a machine learning toolkit for Python.

Below you will find an example on how to use an OSG-provided software container that contains 
scikit-learn. However, it is good to keep in mind that
you have two options when it comes to integrating your own
code:

  1. If the code is simple, send it with the job (this is what the
     example uses)
  2. For more complex codes, consider extending the provided
     containers and integrate the code into the new custom
     container

Containers are detailed in our general documentation:

  * [Containers - Apptainer/Singularity](../../../htc_workloads/using_software/containers-singularity/)

## Scikit-learn Python Code

An example scikit-learn machine learning executable is:


    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    
    # example adopted from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html
    
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn import svm
    
    iris = datasets.load_iris()
    digits = datasets.load_digits()
    
    # learning
    clf = svm.SVC(gamma=0.001, C=100.)
    clf.fit(digits.data[:-1], digits.target[:-1])
    
    # predicting
    print(clf.predict(digits.data[-1:]))
